# Hybrid-Model-of-Wind-Turbine-and-Solar-Power-System

**Project Title**
( The Hybrid Model of Wind Turbine and Solar Power System)

---

## 📖 Description

This project presents an innovative renewable energy solution designed for highway infrastructure. It combines two clean energy sources—**vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT)** and **solar panels**—mounted along highway dividers to harness the wind energy produced by passing vehicles and sunlight.

The project includes a responsive, web-based simulation system where users can:

* Visualize energy data and flow using interactive charts.
* Understand energy generation trends across days and months.
* Experience bilingual (Hindi and English) user interface support.

This eco-friendly model aims to demonstrate how existing infrastructure like highways can be repurposed to generate clean energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

## ⚙️ Features

* **Interactive Dashboard**: Navigate through sections like Overview, Components, Performance, Energy Flow, and Cost Analysis.
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first styles with hide-on-scroll navbar for small screens.
* **Simulation Controls**: Adjust vehicle speed, sun intensity, and number of active LED lights to see real-time performance updates.
* **Charts & Visualization**: Daily and monthly energy production charts (using Chart.js) and cost breakdown pie chart.
* **Language Toggle**: Switch between Hindi and English labels dynamically.
* **PDF Report Generation**: Placeholder button triggering PDF export (to be implemented with jsPDF).

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd highway-hybrid-wind-solar
   ```

2. **Serve locally**

   * You can simply open `index.html` in your browser.
   * For a development server (optional):

     ```bash
     # using Python 3.x
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then visit http://localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Interact**

   * Use the navigation buttons to switch sections.
   * Adjust sliders under the **Performance Data** section to simulate different scenarios.
   * Click the **Generate PDF** button to test the report placeholder.

## 🛠 Technologies

* **HTML5 & CSS3** for structure and styling
* **JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity and data handling
* **Chart.js** for charts and graphs
* **jsPDF** library (planned) for PDF report export
